# Hello-World-Spring-Boot
This is a basic Spring Boot Application with HTML, CSS and JQuery. This will be available for everyone and will be build up using Cloud Native Tools.

## Introduction

This is a test application to learn how to use Spring Boot. This can be run in the terminal or in IntelliJ. In the terminal make sure to have Java installed and also have Maven installed. Maven can be downloaded [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Download IntelliJ [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux). This can be run on IntelliJ by running the main Java class or run the application by first building the dependencies with `mvn package` and then switch to the newly created target directory and run `java -jar <name-of-java-jar>.jar`.
